# text-edit

Text Edit is an app that the user can be used to create code without an internet connection, but they can be retrieved later on. Think of this app as an online drive/notepad that you can use offline but it will reliably save whatever work you've done. This app uses many different coding technologies including MongoDB, Heroku & Workbox.
